# FocusFlow Icons

Place your extension icons here:
- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

You can create these icons using any image editor. The icons should represent the FocusFlow branding (e.g., a focus icon, target, or similar design).

For now, you can use placeholder icons or create simple colored squares as temporary icons.
